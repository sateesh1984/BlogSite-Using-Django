Asynchronous first generation Internet tools such as email have been successfully used in sharing domain\technical knowledge across target audience.
But the scope for collaboration in such technologies however is limited.
Nevertless, the collaborative environment which has received most attention and generated most interest in recent years are blogs (web logs) â€“ essentially a composite enterprise web site and online diary or journal organised either chronologically or thematically. 

The aim of this project is to build a blog website that combines various types of articles and journals posted by subject experts, and collobarate with enterprise staff by allowing them to get reviewed by or read the blog articles.
It aids the knowledge sharing across the community and is a single point solution for information access as it acts as knowledge repository.

Roles & Responsibilities :
1. Build a blog website, that can host various blog articles
2. User management and access controlling for publishing articles
3. Provide review and rating functionality for blog article
4. Bootstraping and custom styling the content as per the requirement
5. Testing and Deploying solution on to client.
